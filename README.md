## About

Adobe速 Photoshop速 has a variety of helpful [blend modes](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/Photoshop/11.0/WSfd1234e1c4b69f30ea53e41001031ab64-77e9a.html) for compositing images from multiple RGBA layers. This small library provides the same functionality for HTML Canvas Contexts, with the goal of producing the same results as Photoshop.

## Syntax

    overContext.blendOnto( underContext, blendMode, offsetOptions );
      - overContext   : A CanvasRenderingContext2D
      - underContext  : A CanvasRenderingContext2D
      - blendMode     : A string with the blend mode to use, e.g. 'screen'
      - offsetOptions : [optional] JS Object with some/all of the following keys:
          destX, destY
          The X/Y location in the 'underContext' to blend onto; both default to 0.
          
          sourceX, sourceY
          The X/Y location in the 'overContext' to blend from; both default to 0.
          
          width,height
          The size of the box to blend; both default to 'auto', blending up to the
          right and bottom edges of the 'over' context.
          
          Width and height may less than specified if there is not enough space
          on the over or under contexts to fit the blend.


## Use

    // Likely an 'offscreen' (not in the DOM) canvas
    var over = someCanvas.getContext('2d'); 
    
    // Usually a canvas that is shown on the page
    var under = anotherCanvas.getContext('2d');
    
    // Blend all of 'over' onto 'under', starting at the upper left corner
    over.blendOnto(under,'screen');
    
    // Blend all of 'over' onto 'under' (again), starting at 17,42 in 'under'
    over.blendOnto(under,'multiply',{destX:17,destY:42});
    
    // Blend a 16x16 tile from 'over' onto 'under' (again), starting at 17,42 in 'under'
    over.blendOnto(under,'add',{destX:17,destY:42,sourceX:32,sourceY:128,width:16,height:16});


## Supported Blend Modes

The following blend modes work perfectly (or as nearly as the [vagaries of the HTML Canvas](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4309364/why-does-html-canvas-getimagedata-not-return-the-exact-same-values-that-were-ju) allow):

 * `normal` (or `src-over`)
 * `screen` 
 * `multiply`
 * `difference`

These blend modes mostly work as intended:

 * `src-in` - the output of this blend mode is slightly different from the effect
   of applying the transparency of one layer as a mask to another; the difference only appears
   in low-opacity areas, however.
 * `add` (or `plus`) - Photoshop's _"Linear Dodge (add)"_ blend mode [does not perform addition](http://www.neilblevins.com/cg_education/additive_mode_in_photoshop/additive_mode_in_photoshop.htm)
   on the opacities of the two layers. I have not yet figured out what it does instead.
   For now, this mode performs simple numeric addition, the same as the SVG 1.2 "plus" mode.

These blend modes are known to be broken:

 * `overlay`
 * `colordodge` (or `dodge`)


## Requirements/Browser Support

Only tested on Safari v5.0 and Chrome. Should work on any user agent that supplies a `CanvasRenderingContext2D`
along with `getImageData` and `putImageData`.


## About

This library was created around the need solely for a one-off 'screen' blend mode to match the company-mandated style for bar graphs used internally, previously only available via a Microsoft速 Excel速 template. Clearly this functionality is useful in more contexts than just my one-off, so I decided to make a framework around it and encourage others to help figure out the formulae. Please, fork this project, add blend modes and/or fix math, and send me pull requests! I feel certain that the resources must exist out there on the equations Photoshop uses in the presence of alpha, but so far I have not found them.
